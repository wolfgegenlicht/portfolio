                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>This project involved redesigning a complex web application from the ground up, focusing on creating a cohesive design system that would scale across multiple product teams. The challenge was to balance user needs with business requirements while maintaining consistency across all touchpoints.</p>
                    
                    <p>The existing application suffered from inconsistent UI elements, poor navigation structure, and accessibility issues. Our goal was to create a unified experience that would improve user satisfaction and reduce development time through reusable components.</p>

                <section class="work-process">
                    <h2>Design Process</h2>
                    <p>I started with comprehensive user research, conducting interviews with 20+ users and analyzing existing usage patterns. This research revealed key pain points in the current workflow and helped prioritize which features needed the most attention.</p>
                    
                    <p>The design system was built with scalability in mind, including detailed component documentation, usage guidelines, and accessibility standards. Every component was tested with real users to ensure it met their needs and expectations.</p>

                <section class="work-results">
                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>The new design system resulted in a 40% increase in user satisfaction scores and a 25% reduction in development time for new features. The unified interface improved task completion rates and reduced user errors significantly.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps most importantly, the design system became a foundation for future product development, enabling the team to move faster while maintaining quality and consistency across all products.</p>
